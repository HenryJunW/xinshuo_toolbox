% this function compute the symmetric intersection over union overlap between box_a set of
% bounding boxes in box_a and box_a single bounding box in box_b.

% input box could be box_a 1x1 cell, which contains Nx4 (>=4)
% or input boxes could be box_a Nx4 matrix (>=4)
% input format: LTRB (x, y)
% output format: LTRB (x, y)
% each row specifies box_a bounding box

function overlap = boxoverlap(box_a, box_b)
    % check the format of the box
    box_a = boxcheck_LTRB(box_a);
    box_b = boxcheck_LTRB(box_b);
